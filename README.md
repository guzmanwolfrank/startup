# startup

## Are you tired of pesky programs that open when you startup your computer? 

1.  Visit https://github.com/guzmanwolfrank/startup/blob/main/startup_programs.py and copy and run the .py file in your IDE or Shell  (VS Code, pycharm, ms powershell) 
2.  If you want to have this file as an executable file, open command prompt and install pysintaller using pip command:
  
    pip install pyinstaller 
    
    
  To make this an executable file (.exe)-- type the following script:
  
  pyinstaller --onefile startup_programs.py
