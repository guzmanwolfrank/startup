# startup

Are you tired of pesky programs that open when you startup your computer? 


## Copy code from my github repositories. 

1.  Visit https://github.com/guzmanwolfrank/startup/blob/main/startup_programs.py and copy the code and save it in a text editor like notepad and name the file 
startup_programs.py. 

## Open Command Prompt 
2.  Open the Run dialog box. The Run dialog box, which you can open using the keyboard shortcut Win + R, allows you to open any Windows program by entering its name. Enter “cmd” and click “OK” to open Command Prompt.

## Navigate to File Location 
3.  Navigate on the command prompt to the file location.  
        
        You can use the cd command to change drives towards the destination while using command prompt.

## Run the Python Script
4.  Once you have located your file location and set it on the command prompt, run the file by typing the following script and pressing enter:
        
        python startup_programs.py 


The program will run and you will see a list of files/apps that open automatically every time you turn your windows pc on:

3.  If you want to have this file as an executable file, open command prompt and install pysintaller using pip command:
  
    pip install pyinstaller 
    
    
  To make this an executable file (.exe)-- type the following script:
  
  pyinstaller --onefile startup_programs.py
